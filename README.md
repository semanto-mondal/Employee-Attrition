**Project Title:** Binary Classification with Employee Attrition Data

**About the Project:**
"Employee Attrition" is an acute problem for an organization. In general, Employees do suffer from layoffs. Sometimes organizations do fire their employees due to different reasons, on the contrary employees also leave the organization because of different factors. Here in this project I will be working on IBM Employee Attrition dataset where the ultimate goal is to find the underlying pattern in the dataset, figuring out the factor affecting the employee attrition as well as to develop an ML model which could further be used in future days to predict whether one employee will continue with the company or not in an early basis so that company can take some preliminary measures to retain their potential employees.
